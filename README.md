# RESTful Server
Boilerplate for a RESTful API server using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Installation
After cloning this repo, install dependencies using:
```
npm install
```

## Usage
Run the MongoDB daemon and start the server:
```
mongod
npm run dev
```

## Why?
Often I find myself needing to rewrite and reimplement code to develop a REST API server. This repo helps streamline that process, giving a simple boilerplate to start from.
